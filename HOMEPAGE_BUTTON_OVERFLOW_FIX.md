# Homepage Button Overflow Fix - Complete Resolution

## 🐛 Issue Summary
The homepage had button overflow issues where the "Transition Demo" and "Refresh Music" buttons were overflowing on smaller screens or with certain text sizes.

## 🔧 Root Cause Analysis
1. **Long Button Text**: "Transition Demo" and "Refresh Music" were too long for constrained Row layout
2. **Missing Text Overflow Handling**: ModernButton and GlassButton widgets didn't handle text overflow properly
3. **Layout Constraints**: Expanded widgets in Row were causing text to overflow instead of truncating

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

### 1. ModernButton Text Overflow Fix
**File**: `lib/core/widgets/modern_button.dart`
- Added `overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis`
- Added `maxLines: 1`
- Added `textAlign: TextAlign.center`
- Applied to both ModernButton and GlassButton text widgets

### 2. Homepage Button Text Optimization
**File**: `lib/ui/home/home_screen.dart`
- Shortened "Transition Demo" → "Transitions"
- Shortened "Refresh Music" → "Refresh"
- Icons remain for clarity (Icons.animation and Icons.refresh)

### 3. Improved Layout Responsiveness
- Text truncation prevents overflow on smaller screens
- Button functionality remains unchanged
- Visual consistency maintained across all button variants

## 📊 Results
