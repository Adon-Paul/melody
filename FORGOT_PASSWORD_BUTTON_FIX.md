# Forgot Password Button Overflow Fix

## 🐛 Issue
The "Send Reset Link" button in the forgot password dialog was overflowing on smaller screens or in constrained dialog layouts.

## 🔧 Solution Applied

### 1. **Shortened Button Text**
- **Before**: "Send Reset Link" (15 characters)
- **After**: "Send Link" (9 characters)
- **Location**: `lib/core/widgets/password_reset_dialog.dart`, line 166

### 2. **Improved Dialog Responsiveness**
- **Before**: Fixed `maxWidth: 400` constraint
- **After**: Dynamic responsive constraints:
  ```dart
  constraints: BoxConstraints(
    maxWidth: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width * 0.9,
    maxHeight: MediaQuery.of(context).size.height * 0.8,
  ),
  width: double.infinity,
  ```

### 3. **Reduced Button Spacing**
- **Before**: `SizedBox(width: 12)` between buttons
- **After**: `SizedBox(width: 8)` between buttons
- **Benefit**: More space for button text in constrained layouts

### 4. **Added Scrollable Content**
- **Added**: `SingleChildScrollView` wrapper around dialog content
- **Benefit**: Prevents overflow on very small screens by allowing scrolling

## ✅ Results
- ✅ Button text no longer overflows
- ✅ Dialog is responsive on all screen sizes
