# ðŸ”§ Context Access Issue Fixed

## Problem Solved
**Issue**: `FlutterError: Looking up a deactivated widget's ancestor is unsafe`

The error occurred in `full_music_player_page.dart` when trying to access `context.read<MusicService>()` during widget disposal.

## Root Cause
- The `dispose()` method was calling `context.read<MusicService>()` after the widget had been deactivated
- This is unsafe because the widget tree context is no longer valid
- Also occurred in timer callbacks when widget was unmounting

## Solution Applied

### âœ… **Safe Service References**
- Added fields to store service references: `_musicService` and `_lyricsService`
- Initialize them once in `initState()` using `context.read()`
- Use the stored references instead of accessing context repeatedly

### âœ… **Safe Disposal Pattern**
```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  // Cancel timer first to prevent any further updates
  _lyricsUpdateTimer?.cancel();
  
  // Remove listener safely without accessing context
  _musicService?.removeListener(_onSongChanged);
  
  // Dispose animation controllers
  _albumRotationController.dispose();
  _fadeController.dispose();
  _lyricsController.dispose();
  _lyricsScrollController.dispose();
  
  super.dispose();
}
```

### âœ… **Mounted Checks**
- Added `if (!mounted)` checks in timer callbacks
- Added null checks for service references
- Prevents operations on disposed widgets

### âœ… **Error Handling**
- Wrapped context access in try-catch blocks
- Cancel timers when context errors occur
- Graceful handling of widget unmounting

## Code Changes Made

1. **Added Service Fields**:
   ```dart
   MusicService? _musicService;
   LyricsService? _lyricsService;
   ```

2. **Initialize in initState()**:
   ```dart
   _musicService = context.read<MusicService>();
   _lyricsService = context.read<LyricsService>();
   ```

3. **Safe Timer Callbacks**:
   ```dart
   if (!mounted || _musicService == null || _lyricsService == null) {
     timer.cancel();
     return;
   }
   ```

4. **Safe Disposal**:
   ```dart
   _musicService?.removeListener(_onSongChanged);
   ```

## Result
- âœ… **No more context access errors**
- âœ… **App builds successfully**
- âœ… **Safe widget lifecycle management**
- âœ… **No memory leaks from listeners**

## Prevention Strategy
This pattern should be used throughout the app:
1. Store service references in `initState()`
2. Use stored references instead of `context.read()` in callbacks
3. Always check `mounted` before state updates
4. Cancel timers and remove listeners in `dispose()`

**Fixed and ready to rock! ðŸŽ¸**
