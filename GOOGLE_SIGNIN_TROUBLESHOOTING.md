# Google Sign-In Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: Account Selection Works, But Authentication Fails

### What's Happening:
✅ **Account selection screen appears** - This means basic OAuth setup is working
❌ **"Google sign in was cancelled or failed"** - Authentication doesn't complete

### Root Cause:
The GoogleSignIn 7.x package has a completely different API than previous versions. The traditional `signIn()` method and constructor have been removed, and the new API requires a different approach to complete authentication.

### What This Means:
1. **OAuth Configuration**: Partially working (account selection appears)
2. **API Usage**: Needs to be updated for GoogleSignIn 7.x
3. **Firebase Integration**: Needs proper token handling for 7.x API

### Immediate Solutions:

#### Option 1: Downgrade to GoogleSignIn 6.x (Recommended for Quick Fix)
```yaml
# In pubspec.yaml, change:
google_sign_in: ^6.2.1  # Instead of ^7.1.1
```

#### Option 2: Use Firebase Auth Only (Web-based approach)
```dart
// For web platforms, bypass GoogleSignIn package entirely
final credential = await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithPopup(GoogleAuthProvider());
```

#### Option 3: Complete GoogleSignIn 7.x Implementation
- Requires understanding the new authentication event system
- Need to properly handle the new API's token exchange mechanism

### Quick Test to Verify OAuth Setup:
The fact that the account selection screen appears means:
- ✅ Google OAuth client ID is configured
- ✅ Firebase project is properly linked
- ✅ Basic authentication flow is working

### Next Steps:
1. **For immediate functionality**: Downgrade to GoogleSignIn 6.x
2. **For production**: Complete the 7.x implementation
3. **Alternative**: Use Firebase Auth web popup for all platforms

### Why This Happened:
GoogleSignIn 7.x introduced breaking changes:
- Removed `GoogleSignIn()` constructor
- Removed `signIn()` method
- Introduced new `authenticate()` and event-based system
- Changed token access patterns

The good news is that your OAuth configuration is working - we just need to use the correct API for the package version you have.
